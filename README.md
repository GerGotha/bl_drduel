Code for the Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord 'DR Duel' server which is a copy of the Mount & Blade Warband Duel system.  
The code was not formatted / refactored etc. since it was created out of curiosity and trying around what is possible while staying Native compatible. It was not supposed to be released at all.
